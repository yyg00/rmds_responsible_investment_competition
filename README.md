# Code Overview
Our code includes six parts: Import Necessary Packages, Exploratory Data Analysis, Portfolio Environmental Score Regression, Portfolio Social Score Regression, Model Development – Random Forest Regressor, and Visualization (Dashboard)

- Import Necessary Packages
  This part includes importing packages such as pandas and sklearn for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis
  This part contains a simple descriptive analysis for the Morningstar data.

- Portfolio Environmental Score Regression
  This part shows the regression of Environmental Score as the dependent variables and
  other independent variables from Morningstar and Bloomberg data.

- Portfolio Social Score Regression
  This part shows the regression of Social Score as the dependent variables and other
  independent variables from Morningstar and Bloomberg data.

- Model Development – Random Forest Regressor
